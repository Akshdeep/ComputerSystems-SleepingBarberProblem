According to the Debug info, when the simulate speed is fixed, the number of customers is aroud 7659,
and fraction of customer visits result in turning away is correct
because the haircut time (1.2 second) and 4 waiting chairs
Average time spent in shop should be haircut time + waitting time, so if average 2 custormer in shop, 
the time should be 2.4 second, so the statistics results are connected and reasonable
and the average waiting time should be larger than haircut time (since there are average 2.37 customers in shop), 
so the fraction of time someone is sitting in the barber's chair should be smaller than 0.5.
